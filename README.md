## Project Highlights
- Compares five production-relevant learners: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, with bootstrap confidence intervals for robust model comparison.
- Serves churn predictions through FastAPI with single-customer scoring, batch scoring, explanations, Prometheus metrics, and rate limiting.
- Provides a Streamlit customer analytics dashboard with executive KPIs, tabbed customer inputs, radial risk scoring, model confidence, CLV, model comparison, sample CSV download, and bulk prediction export.
- Adds retention intelligence with a plain-English analyst brief, prediction/cause/offer/revenue agent outputs, expected churn-reduction estimates, and customer digital twin what-if analysis.
- Evaluates resilience under gradual, sudden, and seasonal drift scenarios to quantify monitoring sensitivity before deployment.
- Audits fairness across operationally relevant customer groups using demographic and plan-based slices.
- Integrates MLflow, DVC, Docker Compose, Prometheus, Grafana, FastAPI, Streamlit, and GitHub Actions for reproducible research and deployment readiness.

## Project Overview
**A Production-Ready MLOps Framework for Customer Churn Prediction with Explainability and Drift Detection** is a deployable machine learning system and a research artifact designed for reproducible churn modeling in real-world environments.

For ML engineers, this repository provides a complete lifecycle implementation: data validation, preprocessing, training, experiment tracking, evaluation, explainability generation, REST API serving, dashboarding, monitoring, drift analysis, and rollback documentation.

For business and retention workflows, the application goes beyond prediction by turning model outputs into operational recommendations. The dashboard combines portfolio-level risk, customer-level prediction, feature impact analysis, recommended save actions, revenue estimates, and scenario simulation in a calmer SaaS-style analytics interface.

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
dvc pull
python src/models/train_extended.py
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open the API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

To run the dashboard separately:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501
```

To start the full containerized stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Service URLs:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| FastAPI | `http://localhost:8000` |
| Customer analytics dashboard | `http://localhost:8501` |
| Prometheus | `http://localhost:9090` |
| Grafana | `http://localhost:3000` |

## Application Interfaces
The project exposes two primary user-facing interfaces:

- **FastAPI serving API**: prediction, batch prediction, SHAP explanation, retention analyst output, retention agent output, digital twin simulation, health checks, and Prometheus metrics.
- **Streamlit customer analytics dashboard**: executive KPI summary, tabbed customer profile form, radial risk score, model confidence, CLV estimate, customer segmentation, SHAP feature impact chart, retention review, PDF/text customer analysis export, sample CSV download, bulk churn prediction, and model comparison.

## Model Results
The experimental pipeline is structured to compare multiple learners under identical preprocessing, imbalance-handling, and evaluation protocols. Use the table below as the project-facing summary of final benchmark performance.

| Model | AUC-ROC (95% CI) | F1 | PR-AUC | Best Imbalance Strategy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| XGBoost | 0.91 (0.88-0.94) | 0.74 | 0.79 | SMOTE |
| LightGBM | 0.90 (0.87-0.93) | 0.72 | 0.77 | Class Weighting |
| CatBoost | 0.89 (0.86-0.92) | 0.71 | 0.76 | SMOTEENN |
| Random Forest | 0.87 (0.84-0.90) | 0.69 | 0.73 | Balanced Subsample |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.86 (0.83-0.89) | 0.67 | 0.71 | Random Oversampling |

See `results/ablation_table.md`, `results/model_comparison.csv`, and `results/bootstrap_ci.csv` for experiment artifacts.

## Explainability
SHAP is used to interpret both global model behavior and individual predictions, making the framework suitable for operational debugging and research reporting. The explainability workflow generates summary plots, dependence plots, and waterfall plots to reveal which customer attributes most strongly influence churn risk.

![SHAP Summary](plots/shap_beeswarm.png)

Explainability utilities live under `src/explainability/`, including `shap_analysis.py` and `generate_shap_artifacts.py`. The dashboard surfaces the customer-level SHAP output as a full-width feature impact analysis with positive/negative contribution labels.

## Retention Intelligence
The retention layer translates model outputs into actions for save teams and customer success workflows.

Current capabilities:

- Plain-English analyst summary with churn probability, risk tier, top drivers, and recommended next actions.
- Agent outputs for prediction, cause analysis, offer selection, and revenue impact.
- Targeted offer suggestions such as service recovery credits, international bundle trials, plan optimization discounts, and adoption nudges.
- Expected churn-reduction badges for recommended save actions.
- Customer digital twin simulation that applies interventions and compares baseline vs intervention churn risk.
- Revenue impact estimates using monthly revenue, offer cost, potential revenue saved, and a configurable annual horizon.

The implementation lives in `src/retention/intelligence.py` and is available from both FastAPI and the Streamlit dashboard.

## Drift Detection
The monitoring layer evaluates model robustness under simulated gradual drift, sudden drift, and seasonal drift. It compares lightweight PSI-style feature drift heuristics with Evidently-based reporting workflows.

Drift artifacts include:

- `reports/drift_report.json`
- `reports/drift_report.html`
- `reports/data_and_target_drift_dashboard.html`
- `results/drift_evaluation.csv`
- `plots/drift_sensitivity_heatmap.png`

## Fairness Audit
The fairness workflow evaluates performance disparities across sensitive operational features such as `state`, `area_code`, and `international_plan`.

Fairlearn `MetricFrame` is used to summarize subgroup behavior and document trade-offs between predictive quality and equitable performance. Report artifacts are written to `results/fairness_report.csv` and `results/fairness_tradeoff.md`.

## Model Rollback
The repository includes rollback guidance for operational recovery when a newly deployed model underperforms, violates service-level expectations, or exhibits unacceptable drift or fairness behavior. See `docs/model_rollback.md` for the rollback procedure, validation checklist, and deployment recovery notes.

This repository also supports a research manuscript titled **A Production-Ready MLOps Framework for Customer Churn Prediction with Explainability and Drift Detection**. The current draft scaffold is available in `paper/paper_skeleton.md`, with additional churn-driver analysis in `paper/churn_drivers_analysis.md`.
